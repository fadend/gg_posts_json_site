Takes the output from https://github.com/fadend/gg_mhtml_to_site and renders it as pagified HTML.

`demo_index.html` is meant for demos and testing. It makes it easy to override the URLs
used for the JSON and base site URL. Just set query params "json_url" and/or "base_url".

`index.html` is meant to be copied into a barebones site root directory.

## Requirements

Formatted with https://prettier.io/. Thanks!
